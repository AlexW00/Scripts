## Scripts

My personal scripts (mostly python because I'm too lazy to properly learn bash)
Proper guide coming soon.

### Usage

To use the scripts you need to:

1. change the python shebang (`#!/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3` at the top of each python file) to a the path of your python executable
2. Create a /obsidian/CONFIG.yaml file with the following structure:

```
---
dailyNote:
  dailyNoteFolder: "path-to-your-daily-note-folder"
  dailyNoteOpenAppPath: "path-to-the-app-you-wish-to-open-daily-notes-with"
```
